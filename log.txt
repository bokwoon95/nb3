SameSite=Lax does not protext against untrusted subdomains for CSRF.
We could have used traditional anti-CSRF mitigations like CSRF tokens for every non GET request and kept the promiscuous subdomains, but CSRF tokens require secret keys in order to do keyed-hashing which inevitably means key management which is something I'd really really like to avoid.
A separate domain for user-generated content is the simplest solution.
But now that I have an additional domain to add to the code, it throws my naming convention out of whack. Previously I was too comfortable with only ever dealing with one RootDomain field, now what do I call the new one? UGCRootDomain?
Having one RootDomain was simple, address.txt either points to a localhost port or it points to a domain name. Now how do I map what's in address.txt to two domains? address1.txt and address2.txt? But having only one address (a localhost address) is a valid configuration.
How then do I indicate (in address.txt)
- Which is the UGC domain?
- Is the UGC domain subdomain or subdirectory? Do we want to support subdirectory?
- Subdirectory is insecure af but non-technical people may like it because it doesn't require getting API keys from the domain registrar. Subdirectory can also live comfortably inside the RootDomain.

Solution:

AdminDomain string
ContentDomain string
MultisiteMode string

address.txt => one or two addresses, maps to AdminDomain and ContentDomain
database.txt
multisite.txt => "subdomain" or "subdirectory", maps to MultisiteMode

dashboard features:
- logout button
- a link to /admin/notes/
- a link to /admin/posts/
- show most recently edited pages
    - each with a link to /admin/pages/:path/
    - a link to /admin/pages/
- form to create a new note and a form to create a new post
    - how to visually distinguish between the note form and the post form? assuming color blindness
- show notes and posts in combined chronological order
    - each with a link to /admin/notes/:note_id/ or /admin/posts/:post_id/
    - how to visually distinguish between a note and a post? assuming color blindness

TODO: Rename all instance of home to dashboard instead. "Home" reminds too much of "homepage" i.e. "/" and not "/admin/"
